## There are several things you should be aware of as a contributor:

1. You are a great human. Seriously. You try to make the world a better place while 90% of population are just selfish consumers.
2. If you have a big idea for the project, let's discuss it first. It would be very sad, if you spent time on something that does not align with project's direction.
3. Commits are better with pull-requests and clear explanation.
4. Good people === good times. Please, be respectful to other folks.
5. If you are the one who found a security bug, mail it to codeallright@protonmail.com ASAP (despite the funny address name).

## Ways to contribute

1. The easiest way to contribute is to fix bad grammar in the docs or files like this.
2. The most creative way to contribute is to make built-in indicators. Although this library is positioned as an assembler, we should have a nice set of standard indicators.
3. If you are true code Jedi, you can help solve performance problems and reactivity bugs. There are already plenty of things to do, just search for **"TODO: IMPORTANT"**
4. If you are a designer and something hurts your eyes, feel free to submit a suggestion. Don't like colors? Or maybe you have an idea for an icon? Tell us!
5. Make a project using this library. This will be a huge contribution.

## Code style guide

1. Please, keep the lines short. 80 chars max.
2. If a .js or .vue module is significantly longer than 250 line, it might be a good idea to split it into two.
3. If a function is longer than 50 lines, then this is definitely a candidate for refactoring.
4. snake_case is everywhere except the top-level component props (TradingVue.vue).
5. The project doesn't use semicolons. Sorry, semicolon lovers.

And finally:

## Let's make the singularity closer (I'm sure it will be fun)!

That's all. I personally hate long and boring docs. Have a great morning/day/evening!
